      <p>
      Hello, I would like to properly introduce myself. My name is Josue
          Paniagua, but you can call me Joshua. I recently graduated from Van
          Alstyne High School and I plan to attend Collin College. Once I have
          completed my prerequisites at Collin I will transfer to the University
          of Texas at Dallas. I want to become a software engineer and work with
          A.I technology. I am currently going through a coding course provided
          by the University of Texas at Austin and I am on my way to mastering
          multiple coding languages. Using the knowledge I gained from the
          course, I plan to start numerous web developing businesses with two
          friend.
